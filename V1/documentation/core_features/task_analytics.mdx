# Task Analytics Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides an overview of the task analytics features available in the platform, focusing on analyzing task performance and patterns. The analytics tools are designed to offer real-time insights and predictions based on actual project data, enhancing decision-making and project management efficiency.

## Testing Task Analytics

### Test Cases

1. **Single Project Analytics**
   - **Steps**:
     1. Login to the platform.
     2. Select only the "INFOSECC" project.
     3. Navigate to `/analytics`.
     4. Verify that the console displays: `selectedProjects: ['INFOSECC']`.
     5. Ensure metrics are specific to the "INFOSECC" project.

2. **Multiple Projects Analytics**
   - **Steps**:
     1. Select both "INFOSECC" and "SEGP" projects.
     2. Navigate to `/analytics`.
     3. Verify that the console displays: `selectedProjects: ['INFOSECC', 'SEGP']`.
     4. Metrics should aggregate data from both projects.
     5. Total issues should be approximately 2000 (1000 from each).

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - **Steps**:
     1. Select any project.
     2. Navigate to `/advanced-analytics`.
     3. Ensure analyses are based on actual data.
     4. Confirm no message like "Nenhuma correlação encontrada" is displayed.
     5. Verify it shows "Análise de XX issues".

4. **Project Selection Change**
   - **Steps**:
     1. In `/analytics`, select "INFOSECC".
     2. Return to the Dashboard.
     3. Change selection to "SEGP" only.
     4. Return to `/analytics`.
     5. Metrics should update automatically.

## Validation Checklist

- Analytics display different data for each project.
- AI analytics provide results (no "Sem resultados").
- Metrics change with project selection.
- Console logs: "Analytics: Processando dados dos projetos selecionados".
- Insights are based on real data.
- Performance metrics are sensible.
- Predictions vary based on data.

## Expected Results

### Before Corrections

- **Analytics Page**:
  - Velocity: 25 pts (always the same)
  - Throughput: 8.5 issues (always the same)
  - Efficiency: 78.5% (always the same)
  - Insights: "Velocity em crescimento" (always the same)

- **Advanced Analytics**:
  - No correlations found
  - Insights Generated: 0

### After Corrections

- **Analytics Page (INFOSECC)**:
  - Velocity: 45 pts (based on INFOSECC data)
  - Throughput: 12.3 issues (based on completed tasks)
  - Efficiency: 65.2% (based on ratio)
  - Insights: "Velocidade baixa" (based on efficiency)

- **Analytics Page (SEGP)**:
  - Velocity: 38 pts (based on SEGP data)
  - Throughput: 10.1 issues
  - Efficiency: 71.8%
  - Insights: "Eficiência em crescimento"

- **Advanced Analytics**:
  - Analysis of 2000 issues (from both projects)
  - Correlations found: 3
  - Insights Generated: 5

## Technical Improvements

### Key Modifications

- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts`: Critical changes to use `useJiraFilters`.
  - `src/pages/AdvancedAnalytics.tsx`: Critical changes to use `useJiraFilters`.

### Technical Notes

- **Why useAnalytics Returned Mock Data**:
  - Issues array was empty.
  - `useMemo` lacked dependencies on issues.
  - Data was hardcoded.

- **AdvancedAnalytics Functionality**:
  - Incorrect credentials handling.
  - Lack of `projectAccessService` usage.

## Advanced Analytics Features

### Implemented Features

- **Correlation Analysis**:
  - Detailed insights and recommendations based on correlation strength.
  - Technical visualization with coefficients and significance.

- **Advanced Metrics**:
  - Performance analysis compared to benchmarks.
  - Automatic insights and specific recommendations.

- **Predictive Analytics**:
  - Confidence analysis of predictions.
  - Specific actions and realistic timelines for implementation.

## Conclusion

The task analytics features provide comprehensive insights into project performance, leveraging real-time data to enhance predictive capabilities and decision-making. The platform's analytics tools are continuously improved to ensure accuracy and relevance, offering valuable insights and actionable recommendations.
