# Quick Setup Guide for Jira Dashboard on AWS

Welcome to the Quick Setup Guide for deploying the Jira Dashboard on AWS. This guide will help you get up and running in approximately 15 minutes. Follow these steps to deploy your application with HTTPS, configure Docker, and ensure your setup is secure and efficient.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Compiled code (locally built)
- Git synchronized
- SSH access to your AWS instance

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Clone or Update the Code (2 minutes)

If this is your first time setting up:

```bash
cd /home/ssm-user
git clone https://github.com/nasario-super/jira-dash.git
cd jira-dash
```

If the repository already exists:

```bash
cd /home/ssm-user/jira-dash
git pull origin master
```

### 2. Install Dependencies (3 minutes)

Install the necessary Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build the Project (2 minutes)

Compile the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Expected result:

```
âœ“ built in 17.12s
```

### 4. Stop Previous Application (1 minute)

Depending on your setup, stop the current application:

- Using PM2:

  ```bash
pm2 stop all
  ```

- Using systemd:

  ```bash
sudo systemctl stop jira-dashboard
  ```

- Using nohup:

  ```bash
pkill -f "serve -s dist"
  ```

### 5. Start the Application (1 minute)

Choose one of the following methods to start the application:

- **PM2 (recommended):**

  ```bash
pm2 start "npm run serve" --name jira-dashboard
  ```

- **Systemd (more robust):**

  ```bash
sudo systemctl restart jira-dashboard
  ```

- **Nohup (simple):**

  ```bash
nohup npm run serve &
  ```

### 6. Configure HTTPS and Nginx (6 minutes)

Set up HTTPS using Nginx:

# Copy Nginx configuration file
sudo cp /tmp/nginx-jira-dashboard.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/jira-dashboard

# Copy SSL certificate if not existing
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/certs /etc/ssl/private
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
- keyout /etc/ssl/private/jira-dashboard.key \
- out /etc/ssl/certs/jira-dashboard.crt

## Docker Setup

### Install Docker and Docker Compose

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your AWS instance:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
exit
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@3.83.28.223
```

### Deploy with Docker

Navigate to your project directory and deploy using Docker:

```bash
cd /home/ssm-user/projetos/jira-dash
./deploy-docker.sh
```

Access your application at `http://3.83.28.223:3000`.

## Summary

This guide provided a concise walkthrough for deploying the Jira Dashboard on AWS using both traditional and Docker-based methods. By following these steps, you ensure a secure, scalable, and efficient deployment of your application.
