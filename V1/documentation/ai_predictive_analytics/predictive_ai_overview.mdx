# Predictive AI Overview

Welcome to the Predictive AI Overview documentation. This page provides an understanding of the AI capabilities and benefits within the Advanced Analytics system, focusing on predictive analytics improvements and features.

## Introduction

The Advanced Analytics system has undergone significant enhancements to improve prediction confidence and usability. These improvements aim to leverage AI capabilities for better decision-making by providing detailed insights, recommendations, and a user-friendly interface.

## Key Improvements in Prediction Confidence

### Identified Issues and Implemented Solutions

#### Problems Encountered

- **Invalid Confidence Values**: Instances of NaN% confidence.
- **Insufficient Data**: Predictions based on inadequate data.
- **Lack of Historical Data**: Limited analysis due to scarce data.
- **Absence of Guidance**: Users were unsure how to improve predictions.

#### Solutions Implemented

1. **Data Quality Analysis System**
   - Automated data quality analysis.
   - Dynamic confidence calculation based on multiple factors.
   - Simulation of historical data when necessary.
   - Quality metrics such as completeness and consistency.

2. **Enhanced Prediction Algorithms**
   - Throughput, Cycle Time, Lead Time, Quality Score, Velocity, and Resolution Time predictions improved with historical trends and temporal analysis.

3. **Interactive Confidence Improvement Guide**
   - Quick wins and detailed improvements by data category.
   - Advanced strategies for maximum confidence.
   - Action plans with timelines and expected results.

### Factors Increasing Confidence

- **Data Volume**: A minimum of 50 issues is recommended, with 100+ issues being ideal, leading to a 40% increase in confidence.

## How to Use the Improvements

1. **Access Advanced Analytics**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/advanced-analytics`.

2. **Navigate to Predictions**
   - Click on "Analytics IA" in the sidebar and go to the "Analytics Preditivos" section.

3. **Explore Details**
   - Click "Ver Detalhes" on any prediction. If confidence is below 80%, the improvement guide will appear automatically.

4. **Follow the Action Plan**
   - Implement quick wins in 1-2 weeks, detailed improvements in 1-2 months, and consider advanced strategies in 3-6 months.

## Success Metrics

- **Prediction Confidence**: Improved from NaN% to 60-95% based on data.
- **Data Quality**: Recommended volume of 50+ issues and 3+ months of historical data.
- **Usability**: Clear guidance for improvements and specific actions for each situation.

## Advanced Analytics Features

### Updated Components

- **PredictionDetailsModal.tsx**: Provides confidence analysis, factors considered, and technical interpretation of results.
- **CorrelationAnalysis.tsx**: Offers detailed correlation analysis with insights and recommendations.
- **AdvancedMetricsCard.tsx**: Displays detailed metrics analysis with benchmarks and trends.

### Interface and User Experience
