# Initial Configuration Guide

Welcome to the initial configuration guide for setting up your Jira Dashboard project. This guide will walk you through the essential steps to configure your environment, ensuring a secure and efficient setup.

## Overview

The Jira Dashboard system is designed to run seamlessly via Docker with automatic initialization, public access, enhanced security, and comprehensive support documentation. This guide focuses on configuring basic settings and preferences to get your system ready for use and monitoring.

## Docker Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. If not, follow these steps:

# Install Docker and Docker Compose
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose

### Deployment

Deploy the Jira Dashboard using Docker:

# Navigate to the project directory
cd /home/ssm-user/projetos/jira-dash

# Execute the deployment script
./deploy-docker.sh

# Access the application
http://3.83.28.223:3000

## Security Configuration

### Credentials Management

- Credentials should be provided via the user interface rather than environment variables in production.
- Ensure the `.env` file does not contain sensitive information like `JIRA_DOMAIN`, `EMAIL`, or `API_TOKEN`.

### Network Security

- The application is accessible via a public IP: `3.83.28.223:3000`.
- Ensure port 3000 is open and SSH keep-alive is optimized.

## SSH Configuration

To maintain active SSH sessions and prevent timeouts, configure your SSH settings:

# ~/.ssh/config

Host jira-aws
HostName 3.83.28.223
User ec2-user
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/jira-key.pem

# Keep-alive settings
ServerAliveInterval 60
ServerAliveCountMax 10

# Connection settings
ConnectTimeout 10
StrictHostKeyChecking no
UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null

# Compression for faster connections
Compression yes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Docker Command Not Found**: Reinstall Docker or use the full path `/usr/bin/docker`.
- **Permission Denied**: Add your user to the Docker group and re-login.
- **Container Fails to Start**: Check logs with `docker-compose logs -f`.

### SSH Timeout

Test your SSH configuration to ensure it maintains the connection:

# Connect to the server
ssh jira-aws

# Leave the session idle for 15 minutes

# Attempt to execute a command
echo "test"

# If the session remains active, the timeout issue is resolved.

## Summary

This guide provided a step-by-step approach to configure your Jira Dashboard environment, focusing on Docker deployment, security settings, and SSH configuration. By following these instructions, you ensure a robust and secure setup ready for production use.

For further assistance, refer to the detailed documentation files such as `INSTALACAO_DOCKER_AWS.md` and `MANTER_SSH_ATIVA.md` for specific troubleshooting and configuration guidance.
