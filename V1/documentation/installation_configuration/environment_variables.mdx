# Environment Variables

This documentation provides a comprehensive reference for configuring environment variables for the Jira Dashboard application. It covers the setup of environment variables in both production and Docker environments, ensuring secure and efficient configuration.

## Production Environment Variables

In a production environment, it is crucial to handle environment variables securely to prevent exposure of sensitive information. The `.env` file should be used cautiously, and sensitive credentials should not be included.

### Creating a .env File

To create a `.env` file for production, follow these steps:

# Create .env file
cat &gt; .env &lt;< 'EOFENV'

# Note: In production, credentials should be provided via login,

# not through environment variables!

# Do not add JIRA_DOMAIN, EMAIL, or API_TOKEN here!

# Optional: URLs for logging, analytics, etc.
VITE_API_URL=https://your-domain.com
VITE_ENABLE_LOGS=true
EOFENV

### Security Considerations

- **Do Not Expose Credentials**: Avoid placing sensitive credentials such as `JIRA_DOMAIN`, `EMAIL`, or `API_TOKEN` in the `.env` file.
- **User Login for Credentials**: Ensure that credentials are provided through user login rather than environment variables in production.

## Docker Environment Variables

When deploying the Jira Dashboard application using Docker, environment variables can be configured directly in the `docker-compose.yml` file or through a `.env` file.

### Configuring Environment Variables in Docker

#### docker-compose.yml Example

```yaml
services:
jira-dashboard:
build: .
ports:
- "3000:3000"
environment:
- NODE_ENV=production
- VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.com
- LOG_LEVEL=info
restart: always
```

#### Using a .env File with Docker Compose

# .env
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.com
```

To use the `.env` file with Docker Compose, execute:

```
docker-compose --env-file .env up -d

## Summary

This documentation outlines the secure and efficient configuration of environment variables for the Jira Dashboard application. In production, ensure that sensitive credentials are not exposed in the `.env` file and are instead provided through user login. For Docker deployments, environment variables can be set in the `docker-compose.yml` file or a separate `.env` file, ensuring a flexible and secure setup.
