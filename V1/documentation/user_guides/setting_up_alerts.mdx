# Setting Up Alerts

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to configuring alerts for important metrics and events using the Jira Dashboard. Alerts help in monitoring critical aspects of your projects, ensuring timely responses to issues and maintaining project quality.

## Introduction to Alerts

Alerts in the Jira Dashboard are designed to notify users about significant changes or issues in project metrics. These alerts can be configured to trigger based on various criteria, such as defect rates, bug resolution times, and user workload.

## Configuring Alerts

### Types of Alerts

1. **Issues Atrasadas (Delayed Issues)**
   - Clickable alert that opens a modal with detailed information.

2. **Velocity Baixa (Low Velocity)**
   - Provides insights into project progress and potential delays.

3. **Usu√°rios Sobrecarregados (Overloaded Users)**
   - Identifies users with an excessive workload, allowing for better task distribution.

### Setting Up Alerts

To set up alerts, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Agile Dashboard**
   - Navigate to the **Alertas** tab within the Agile Dashboard.

2. **Configure Alert Criteria**
   - Define the conditions under which each alert should trigger. For example, set a threshold for defect rates or bug resolution times.

3. **Enable Notifications**
   - Ensure that notifications are enabled for the alerts you configure, so you receive timely updates.

### Viewing and Managing Alerts

- **Interactive Modal Views**
  - Click on an alert to view detailed information in a modal. This includes related issues and their statuses.

- **Expandable Lists**
  - Alerts are organized in expandable lists, allowing you to view all relevant items without clutter.

## Monitoring Project Metrics

### Quality Metrics

- **Taxa de Defeitos (Defect Rate)**
  - Ideal: Less than 20%
  - Alert: More than 30%

- **Tempo para Resolver Bugs (Time to Resolve Bugs)**
  - Quick: Less than 2 days
  - Normal: 2-5 days
  - Slow: More than 5 days

- **Cobertura de Testes (Test Coverage)**
  - Percentage of issues with tests and bugs found post-release.

- **Retrabalho (Rework)**
  - Low: Less than 10% (good)
  - High: More than 20% (problematic)

### Automatic Insights

- **Trends**
  - Patterns in velocity and activity peaks.

- **Anomaly Detection**
  - Sudden drops in velocity or abnormal increases in bugs.

- **Recommendations**
  - Suggestions for prioritizing critical bugs and balancing team workloads.

## Summary

Setting up alerts in the Jira Dashboard allows for proactive management of project metrics. By configuring alerts for key indicators such as defect rates and user workload, teams can ensure timely interventions and maintain project quality. Utilize the interactive features of the dashboard to manage alerts effectively and gain insights into project health.
