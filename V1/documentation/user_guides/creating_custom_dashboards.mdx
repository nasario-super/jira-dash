- **Customization**: Includes advanced filters for specific analyses by project, team, period, or work type.

### Target Audience

- **Primary**: Executives, project managers, and team leaders.
- **Secondary**: Product owners, scrum masters, and analysts.

## Key Features

### Functionalities

- **Main KPIs**: Total open issues, completed issues, completion rate, average resolution time, team velocity, and overdue issues.
- **Graphical Visualizations**: Burndown charts, issues by status/type, team velocity, and priority distribution.
- **Advanced Filters**: Filter by project, sprint, issue type, status, assignee, priority, and period.
- **Recent Activity**: List of the latest updated issues with direct links to Jira.
- **Responsive Layout**: Adaptable interface for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Complete Integration**: Direct connection to the Jira Cloud API.

velocity: processVelocityData(data.issues),
issueTypes: processIssueTypeData(data.issues),
timeline: processTimelineData(data.issues),

};
}, [data]);

return (
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-50">
