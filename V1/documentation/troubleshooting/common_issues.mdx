- Verify Jira access permissions.

### Discrepancies in Issue Numbers

#### Causes:
- Synchronization delay (5-10 minutes).
- Different filters applied.
- Sub-items not included in the count.

#### Solutions:
- Click on "Update" to refresh data.
- Wait for 5 minutes and check again.
- Verify and adjust filters as necessary.

### User Not Appearing

#### Causes:

- The user has left the project.
- The user account is deactivated.

#### Solutions:
- Reassign issues to the user.
- Invite the user back to the project.

## Performance and Analysis Tips

### For Better Performance
- Limit usage to 1-3 projects at a time.
- Remove unnecessary filters.
- Reload the page if it becomes slow.

### For Improved Analysis
- Compare data over different periods (e.g., week vs. month).
- Focus on trends rather than isolated peaks.
- Consider external context when analyzing data.

### For Enhanced Collaboration
- Share reports with team members.
- Use insights for one-on-one discussions.
- Discuss anomalies with the team for better understanding.

## Data Filtering and Analysis

### Identified Problems
1. Incorrect project displays.
2. Inconsistent issue counts.
3. Missing projects in the interface.

### Solutions Implemented
- A new data validation service (`projectAccessService.ts`) was introduced to ensure accurate project access and data display.
