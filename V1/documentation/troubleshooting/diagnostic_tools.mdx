# Diagnostic Tools for System Diagnosis

This guide provides an overview of the built-in tools available for diagnosing and troubleshooting issues within the Jira Dashboard system. These tools are essential for maintaining optimal performance and ensuring smooth operation.

## System Configuration and Deployment

The Jira Dashboard system is configured to run via Docker with automatic startup, public access, enhanced security, and comprehensive documentation support. It is ready for use and monitoring.

### Key Configuration Files

- **Dockerfile**: Defines the Docker image.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Manages orchestration.
- **deploy-docker.sh**: Automates deployment.

### Deployment Steps

To deploy the system using Docker, follow these steps:

# Install Docker and Docker Compose if not already installed
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose

# Navigate to the project directory and deploy
cd /home/ssm-user/projetos/jira-dash
./deploy-docker.sh

# Access the application

# http://3.83.28.223:3000

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Docker Installation Issues

If Docker fails to install, refer to `INSTALACAO_DOCKER_AWS.md` for detailed installation instructions.

### SSH Timeout

To address SSH timeout issues, consult `MANTER_SSH_ATIVA.md`.

### Container Startup Failures

If a container does not start, use the following command to view logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Disk Space Management

To free up disk space, use the following Docker commands:

# Remove unused images
docker image prune -a

# Remove stopped containers
docker container prune

# Remove unused volumes
docker volume prune

# Clean up everything
docker system prune -a

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Monitoring Container Resources

Monitor the resources used by the container with:

```bash
docker stats jira-dashboard
```

### Viewing Logs

Access logs for troubleshooting:

# View logs with timestamps
docker logs jira-dashboard -t

# Follow logs in real-time
docker logs jira-dashboard -f

## Advanced Diagnostics

### Analyzing Code and Data Discrepancies

For issues related to incorrect data calculations on the dashboard, analyze the following files:

- **`src/services/filterService.ts`**: Potential issues with undefined data.
- **`src/services/jiraApi.ts`**: Incorrect data fields returned.

### Debugging Steps

1. **Correct API Usage**: Remove access to `response.data.total` and use `response.data.issues.length` for local counts.
2. **User and Issue Validation**: Ensure all users and issues are correctly fetched and deduplicated.

## Summary

This guide provides essential tools and steps for diagnosing and troubleshooting the Jira Dashboard system. By following the outlined procedures, users can effectively manage and resolve common issues, ensuring the system operates efficiently.
