cd jira-dash
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
npm install
   ```

3. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
npm run build
   ```

4. **Serve the Application**
   - **Option 1: Simple Server**
     ```bash
npm install -g serve
serve -s dist -l 3000
     ```
   - **Option 2: PM2 (Recommended for Production)**
     ```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start pm2.config.js
     ```

sudo chown -R ssm-user:ssm-user /home/ssm-user/projetos/jira-dash
  ```

- **PM2 Startup Issues**
  ```bash
pm2 startup
pm2 save
  ```

- **Build Failures**
  ```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
  ```
