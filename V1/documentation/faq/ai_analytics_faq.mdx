# AI & Analytics FAQ

Welcome to the AI & Analytics FAQ page. This document provides answers to frequently asked questions about the AI and analytics features in our system. It covers the functionality, testing procedures, and improvements made to ensure a robust analytics experience.

## Overview

The analytics project is fully functional with all features and buttons tested and implemented correctly. This includes AI insights, anomaly detection, automatic insights, and predictive analytics. The system is designed to provide detailed analysis, specific recommendations, and an intuitive interface for users, developers, and businesses.

## Key Features and Functionality

### AI Insights

- **Details Button**: The AI Insights panel includes a "Details" button that, when clicked, displays an alert with detailed information about the insight, including title, description, confidence, and impact.

### Anomaly Detection

- **Investigate Button**: This feature allows users to investigate anomalies by clicking the "Investigate" button, which triggers an alert displaying the type, metric, severity, description, and values of the anomaly.

### Predictive Analytics

- **Prediction Cards**: The predictive analytics section displays three prediction cards for the next sprint, month, and quarter. Each card shows realistic values and a confidence level between 45-95%.

## Testing Procedures

### Basic Testing

1. **Stopping and Restarting the System**:
   - Use `Ctrl+C` to stop the current process.
   - Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
   - Refresh the page with `F5`.

2. **Navigating to Analytics**:
   - Go to `/analytics` to access the analytics dashboard.
   - Test all buttons to ensure they function correctly.

### Project-Specific Testing

- **Single Project Analytics**:
  - Select a specific project (e.g., INFOSECC) and verify that the metrics displayed are accurate for that project.

- **Multiple Projects Analytics**:
  - Select multiple projects (e.g., INFOSECC and SEGP) and ensure that metrics are aggregated correctly.

### Advanced Analytics

- **Accessing Advanced Analytics**:
  - Navigate to `/advanced-analytics` to explore detailed analyses and recommendations.
  - Check that insights are based on real data and that no "No correlation found" messages are displayed.

## Improvements and Enhancements

### Data and Predictions

- **Realistic Predictions**: The system now uses real project data instead of fixed values, resulting in dynamic and relevant metrics and insights.
- **Confidence Levels**: Predictions show a confidence range of 45-95%, with a guide for improvements if confidence is below 80%.

### User Interface and Experience

- **Intuitive Design**: The interface features responsive modals, intuitive icons, and a clear layout for easy navigation.
- **Detailed Recommendations**: Users receive specific recommendations for each situation, enhancing decision-making processes.

## Summary
