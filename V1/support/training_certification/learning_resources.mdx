## Security with Self-Signed Certificates

### Self-Signed Certificate for Node.js App

- **Protection Against Attacks:**
  - Encrypts traffic to protect against sniffing and man-in-the-middle attacks.
  - Uses TLS 1.2/1.3 for secure communication.

- **Limitations:**
  - Browsers will show a warning for self-signed certificates.
  - Users need to manually bypass the warning.

### Certificate Renewal

- Certificates are valid for 365 days.
- Renewal involves generating a new certificate and restarting Nginx.

```bash
sudo su -
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
- keyout /etc/ssl/private/jira-dashboard.key \
- out /etc/ssl/certs/jira-dashboard.crt \
- subj "/C=BR/ST=SP/L=Sao Paulo/O=SeuEmpresa/CN=3.83.28.223"
systemctl restart nginx
```

## Deployment Checklist

- Ensure all tests pass.
- Build without errors using `npm run build`.
- Configure `.env.production` with correct credentials.
- Enable HTTPS on the proxy.
- Securely store the API token.
