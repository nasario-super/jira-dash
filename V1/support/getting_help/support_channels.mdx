- **Consult Documentation**: Review the Jira API documentation, as well as the React and TypeScript documentation, for additional insights and guidance.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Error 401 Unauthorized

If you encounter a 401 Unauthorized error after deployment, verify the following:

1. Ensure the token is correct in the login form.
2. Check if the proxy is passing the Authorization header.

4. Verify that `reinitializeJiraApi()` is called after login.

### CORS Error

To resolve CORS errors, check:

2. The target URL is correct (e.g., `https://superlogica.atlassian.net`).
3. `changeOrigin` is set to true.
