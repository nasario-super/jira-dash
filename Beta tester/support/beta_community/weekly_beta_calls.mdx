# Weekly Beta Calls

## Introduction

Weekly Beta Calls are regular video meetings conducted with beta testers to provide support, gather feedback, and discuss ongoing development efforts. These calls are a crucial part of the beta testing phase, ensuring that testers are well-informed and can contribute effectively to the project's progress.

## Call Focus and Agenda

### Main Focus Areas

The weekly calls typically focus on several key areas to ensure the project's success:

1. **TypeScript Warnings**: Addressing and resolving any TypeScript warnings to maintain code quality.
2. **Jira Endpoints Exploration**: Investigating alternative Jira endpoints to enhance data integration.
3. **Progressive Web App (PWA) Implementation**: Developing a fully functional PWA that is installable and works offline.
4. **Integration Testing**: Conducting integration tests to ensure all components work seamlessly together.

### Goals for the Next Session

- Achieve a 100% functional application without any warnings.
- Ensure real data is consistently working within the application.
- Complete the PWA implementation to be installable and functional offline.
- Implement basic tests to validate the application's functionality.

## Reporting and Communication

### How to Report Issues

If any issues are encountered during testing, follow these steps to report them:

1. **Capture a Screenshot**: Take a screenshot of the issue.
2. **Collect Logs**: Open DevTools (F12) and capture console logs.
3. **Provide Information**:
   - Browser and version
   - Selected projects
   - Active tab (Overview/Daily/Velocity/Alerts)
   - Actions being performed

4. **Submit the Report**:
   ```
[Include screenshot + logs + information]

Description: Steps to reproduce + Expected vs. Actual outcome
   ```

### Commit and Push Changes

After successful testing, commit the changes using the following commands:

```bash
git add src/pages/AgileDashboard.tsx
git add src/components/dashboard/DailyScrumDashboard.tsx
git add src/components/dashboard/AlertSystem.tsx
git commit -m "âœ¨ Critical fixes for Agile Dashboard: metrics, Daily list, interactive alerts"
