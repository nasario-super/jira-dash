## Agile Dashboard Testing Guide

### How to Test

#### Step 1: Compile and Launch the Server

To begin testing, compile the application and start the server using the following commands:

```bash
cd /home/anderson.nasario/Documentos/Nasario/jira-dash

```

# Compile
npm run build

# Or use dev mode
npm run dev
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

```

#### Step 2: Validate Key Metrics

- **Login**: Use credentials from the `.env` file.
- **Select Projects**: Choose **INFOSECC** and **SEGP**.
- **Navigate**: Go to **Agile Dashboard** → **Overview**.

**Expected Metrics**:
- Total Issues: ~200
- Completed: ~45
- In Progress: ~30
- Blocked: ~8
- Overdue: ~11
- Completion Percentage: ~22%

#### Step 3: Daily Scrum with Expandable List

- **Navigate**: Agile Dashboard → Tab **Daily Scrum**.
- **Expected**: Lists should be expandable with items for yesterday and today.

### Reporting Errors

If you encounter any errors during testing:

1. **Screenshot**: Capture the screen.
2. **Logs**: Open DevTools (F12) → Console.
3. **Information**:
   - Browser and Version
   - Selected Projects
   - Active Tab (Overview/Daily/Velocity/Alerts)
   - Actions being performed

4. **Submit Report**:
   ```
[Include screenshot + logs + information]

Title: [BUG] Brief Description
Description: Steps to reproduce + Expected vs Actual Outcome
   ```

### Commit Changes After Successful Tests

If all tests pass, commit the changes with the following commands:

```bash
git add src/pages/AgileDashboard.tsx
git add src/components/dashboard/DailyScrumDashboard.tsx
git add src/components/dashboard/AlertSystem.tsx
git commit -m "✨ Correções críticas do Agile Dashboard: métricas, Daily list, alertas interativos"
git push origin main
```

## Additional Testing Areas

### Analytics Page Testing

Ensure all components and buttons on the `/analytics` page function correctly:

- **AI Insights Panel**: Click "Details" to view insights.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Click "Investigate" for anomaly details.
- **Automatic Insights**: Click to expand or view details.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Ensure it displays three prediction cards.

### Dynamic Filters and Optimized Graphs

The system allows real-time filtering of Jira data, updating all graphs and metrics dynamically. This ensures efficient use of visual space and legibility across different screen sizes.

### Error Handling and Security

- **Improved API Error Handling**: Custom user messages for different error statuses.
- **Authentication Tests**: Ensure login functionality and secure token handling.
