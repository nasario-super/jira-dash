## Recent Corrections

### Agile Dashboard Corrections

Several critical issues with the Agile Dashboard have been addressed to ensure accurate data representation:

- **Completed Issues Display**: The logic for detecting completed issues has been corrected to reflect the actual number of completed tasks. [Source 4](/gitdocai-data/organization/org-3b5b9a00-5655-4c1f-96df-503f2619fb1c/repositories/jira-dash/CORRECOES_AGILE_IMPLEMENTADAS.md)

- **Status Detection**: Improvements in status detection ensure that issues "In Progress" and "Blocked" are counted correctly, including terms in Portuguese. [Source 9](/gitdocai-data/organization/org-3b5b9a00-5655-4c1f-96df-503f2619fb1c/repositories/jira-dash/CORRECOES_AGILE_IMPLEMENTADAS.md)

- **Daily Scrum List**: The Daily Scrum list now displays all items with scrolling, instead of truncating to five. [Source 9](/gitdocai-data/organization/org-3b5b9a00-5655-4c1f-96df-503f2619fb1c/repositories/jira-dash/CORRECOES_AGILE_IMPLEMENTADAS.md)

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Challenges

The Agile Dashboard still faces some critical display issues, particularly in the counting and visualization of completed issues:

- **Incorrect Status Usage**: The use of status fields may not be consistent, leading to incorrect display of completed tasks. [Source 10](/gitdocai-data/organization/org-3b5b9a00-5655-4c1f-96df-503f2619fb1c/repositories/jira-dash/PROBLEMAS_AGILE_DASHBOARD.md)

- **Layout and Responsiveness**: Some layout issues persist, affecting the responsiveness and data presentation in the dashboard. [Source 10](/gitdocai-data/organization/org-3b5b9a00-5655-4c1f-96df-503f2619fb1c/repositories/jira-dash/PROBLEMAS_AGILE_DASHBOARD.md)

## Summary

The recent updates and corrections have significantly improved the usability and accuracy of the issue management system within the Beta testing phase. Enhancements to the issue modals and Agile Dashboard have addressed several critical issues, although some challenges remain. Continuous monitoring and further improvements are planned to ensure optimal functionality and data accuracy.
