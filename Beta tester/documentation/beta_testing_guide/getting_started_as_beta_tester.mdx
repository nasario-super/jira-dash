# Getting Started as a Beta Tester

Welcome to the Beta Testing Guide for the Jira Dashboard project. This guide provides essential information and instructions to help you get started as a beta tester, ensuring you can effectively contribute to the testing and improvement of the project.

## Introduction to Beta Testing

Beta testing is a critical phase in software development where real users test the application in a real-world environment. As a beta tester, you will help identify bugs, provide feedback on usability, and suggest improvements. This guide will walk you through the steps needed to set up, test, and report your findings.

## Setting Up Your Environment

### Compiling and Launching the Server

To begin testing, you need to compile and launch the server. Follow these steps:

```bash
cd /home/anderson.nasario/Documentos/Nasario/jira-dash

```

# Compile the project
npm run build

# Or run in development mode
npm run dev
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

```

## Testing Procedures

### Project Selection Flow

The project selection and discovery flow ensures a controlled and user-friendly process:

1. **Login**: Upon logging in, you will be prompted to select projects.
2. **Project Discovery**: The system will display "Carregando Projetos" during discovery.
3. **Project Selection**: Once discovery is complete, select the projects you wish to test.
4. **Dashboard Access**: Access to the dashboard is granted only after project selection.
