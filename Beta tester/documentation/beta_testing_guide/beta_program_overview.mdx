# Beta Program Overview

Welcome to the Beta Testing Program for the Jira Dashboard. This document serves as an introduction to the beta testing program, outlining the expectations and providing essential information for beta testers.

## Introduction

The Beta Testing Program is designed to gather feedback on new features and improvements before they are released to the public. As a beta tester, you play a crucial role in helping us identify issues and improve the overall quality of our product.

## Project Selection and Discovery Flow

Recent improvements have been made to the project selection and discovery flow to enhance user experience:

- **Project Selection**: After logging in, users are required to select projects. This ensures a controlled and user-friendly process.
- **Feedback During Discovery**: Clear feedback is provided during the project discovery phase. Users will see messages such as "Carregando Projetos" during automatic discovery, "Descoberta Concluída" when successful, and "Descoberta Falhou" if it fails.
- **Dashboard Access**: Access to the dashboard is only granted once projects are selected, ensuring that users follow the correct flow: Login → Project Selection → Dashboard.

## Testing Procedures

### Complete Flow Test

1. Log in to the system.
2. A project selection screen should appear.
3. The status "Carregando Projetos" will be displayed during discovery.
4. Once loading is complete, available projects will be shown.
5. Select the desired projects and confirm the selection.
6. Access the dashboard with the selected projects.

### Discovery Test
