# Beta Testing Timeline

This document provides an overview of the timeline and milestones for the beta testing program. It is designed to guide beta testers through the essential phases of the testing process, ensuring a structured and efficient evaluation of the system.

## Timeline Overview

The beta testing program is structured into several key phases, each with specific goals and expected outcomes. The timeline is realistic and designed to ensure thorough testing and feedback collection.

### Key Phases

1. **Initial Setup and Access**
   - **Access Advanced Analytics**: Navigate to the analytics section to begin testing.
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/advanced-analytics`

2. **Exploration and Feedback**
   - **Explore Predictions**: Navigate to "Analytics Preditivos" and explore the details of predictions.
   - If prediction confidence is below 80%, a guide for improvement will be provided automatically.

3. **Implementation of Quick Wins**
   - **Timeline**: Implement quick wins within 1-2 weeks.
   - Focus on immediate improvements that can be rapidly deployed.

4. **Detailed Improvements**
   - **Timeline**: Execute detailed improvements over 1-2 months.
   - These improvements require more in-depth analysis and changes.

5. **Advanced Strategies**
   - **Timeline**: Consider advanced strategies over 3-6 months.
   - These strategies involve comprehensive changes and optimizations.

## Success Metrics

The success of the beta testing program is measured through several key metrics:

1. **Prediction Confidence**
   - **Before**: NaN% (invalid)
   - **After**: 60-95% based on data
   - **Improvement**: +60-95% confidence

2. **Data Quality**
   - **Volume**: 50+ issues recommended
   - **Temporal**: 3+ months of historical data
   - **Consistency**: 80%+ of data complete

3. **Usability**
   - Clear guidance for improvements
   - Specific actions for each situation
   - Real-time projected results

## Final Status

The final status of the beta testing program includes the successful implementation of several key components:

- Quality analysis system
- Improved prediction algorithms with historical data
- Interactive improvement guide for confidence
- Intuitive interface with clear guidance
- Personalized action plans for each user
- Real-time projected results

## Next Steps

Following the completion of the beta testing program, the following steps are recommended:

1. Compile and test the system using the provided commands:
   ```bash
npm run build
npm run dev
   ```

2. Test scenarios including project selection, dashboard overview, and updated metrics.

3. Validate data by comparing with console logs and Jira UI.
