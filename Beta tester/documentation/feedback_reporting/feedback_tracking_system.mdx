# Feedback Tracking System

## Introduction

Welcome to the Feedback Tracking System documentation for beta testers. This guide provides an overview of how to track your submitted feedback effectively. The system is designed to help you monitor the status of your feedback and ensure that it is addressed appropriately.

## Key Features

### Agile Dashboard

The Agile Dashboard offers a comprehensive view of the current sprint, including:

- **Total Issues**: Number of issues in the current sprint.
- **Completed**: Percentage of issues completed.
- **In Progress**: Issues currently being worked on.
- **Blocked**: Issues that are currently blocked.
- **Overdue**: Issues that have surpassed their due date.

#### Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum feature lists issues for the day, providing:

- Current status
- Responsible person
- Priority level
- Due date

This feature is useful for daily standups, identifying blockers, and tracking sprint progress.

### Intelligent Alerts

The system automatically detects and alerts you about:

- Overdue issues
- Blocked issues
- High bug rates
- Overloaded capacity

Clicking on an alert will display related issues for further action.

## Executive Dashboard

The Executive Dashboard is tailored for directors and managers, offering key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

- **Velocity**: Number of issues completed per sprint.
- **Throughput**: Rate of delivery.
- **Cycle Time**: Average time taken to resolve an issue.
- **Lead Time**: Time from request to completion.
- **Efficiency**: Percentage of issues completed.

Visual representations include productivity trends over time, distribution by type (bugs vs tasks), and project performance.

## Quality Metrics

### Defect Rate

The system tracks the defect rate, comparing bugs found against total issues:

- **Ideal**: Less than 20%
- **Alert**: Greater than 30%

### Bug Resolution Time

Time taken to resolve bugs is categorized as:

- **Fast**: Less than 2 days
- **Normal**: 2-5 days
- **Slow**: More than 5 days

### Test Coverage

If integrated, the system shows:

- Percentage of issues with tests
- Bugs found post-release

### Rework

Rework is measured by the ratio of reopened issues to resolved issues:

- **Low**: Less than 10% (good)
- **High**: More than 20% (problematic)

## How to Use Filters

To effectively track feedback, use the filter bar to:

1. Select desired options:
   - **Status**: Open, In Progress, Completed, etc.
   - **Type**: Bug, Task, Epic, etc.
   - **Priority**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
   - **Responsible**: Select users

2. Data updates automatically based on selected filters.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any errors, follow these steps to report them:

1. **Capture a Screenshot**: Take a screenshot of the issue.
2. **Logs**: Open DevTools (F12) and check the console for logs.
3. **Information**: Include browser version, selected projects, active tab, and actions taken.
4. **Submit**: Send the details with a title and description of the issue.

## Summary

This guide provides an overview of the Feedback Tracking System's capabilities, including dashboards for tracking issues, intelligent alerts, and quality metrics. Use the filtering options to customize your view and report any issues using the outlined process. For further assistance, refer to the technical documentation or contact your administrator.
