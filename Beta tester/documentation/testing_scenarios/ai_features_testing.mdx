## Introduction to AI Features

The AI features in the analytics module are designed to provide predictive insights and actionable recommendations based on historical data. This guide outlines the testing procedures to ensure these features are functioning correctly and delivering accurate results.

## Testing Scenarios

### Prediction Card Fixes

The prediction card now displays realistic values with confidence levels between 45-95%. It includes eight factors and an automatic improvement guide when confidence is low.

#### How to Test the Fixes

1. **Access Advanced Analytics**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/advanced-analytics`.

2. **Navigate to Predictions**
   - Click on "Analytics IA" in the sidebar.
   - Go to "Analytics Preditivos".

3. **Verify the Cards**
   - Confidence should show 45-95%.
   - Values should be realistic.
   - Eight factors should be displayed.
   - Click "Ver Detalhes" for the improvement guide.

4. **Test the Improvement Guide**
   - If confidence is below 80%, the guide will appear automatically.
   - Explore the tabs: Quick Wins, Detailed Improvements, Advanced Strategies.
   - Follow the recommended action plan.

### Analytics Module Testing

The analytics module has been tested to confirm that all components and buttons function correctly and display the expected information.

#### Key Tests

- **AI Insights Panel**
  - Click "Detalhes" to display insights.

- **Anomaly Detection**
  - Click "Investigar" to display anomaly details.

- **Insights Autom√°ticos**
  - Click to expand or display details.

- **Analytics Preditivos**
  - Verify the display of three prediction cards: Next Sprint, Next Month, Next Quarter.

### Prediction Confidence Improvements
