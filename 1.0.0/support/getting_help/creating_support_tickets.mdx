## Introduction

This guide provides instructions on how to submit effective support requests for issues related to the Jira Dashboard. It includes steps for troubleshooting, optimizing performance, and ensuring proper project configuration. The document aims to help users efficiently resolve common problems and seek assistance when needed.

## How to Submit a Support Request

For support and questions related to the Jira Dashboard, consider the following steps:

1. **Open a GitHub Issue**: If you encounter a problem or have a question, the primary method for seeking support is by opening an issue on GitHub. This allows the development team to track and address your concern systematically.

2. **Consult Documentation**: Before submitting a request, check the available documentation:
   - **Jira API Documentation**: Provides insights into API usage and troubleshooting.
   - **React and TypeScript Documentation**: Useful for understanding the underlying technologies used in the Jira Dashboard.

3. **Contact the Administrator**: If the documentation does not resolve your issue, contact your system administrator for further assistance.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Common Problems and Solutions

- **"Nenhuma issue encontrada"**:
  - **Causes**: Project without issues, overly restrictive filters, or user access issues.
  - **Solutions**: Clear all filters, select a different project, or verify Jira access.

- **"Números diferentes do Jira"**:
  - **Causes**: Synchronization delay, different filters, or sub-item issues.
  - **Solutions**: Click update, wait five minutes, and check filters.

- **"Usuário não aparece"**:
  - **Causes**: User without assigned issues, removed from the project, or deactivated.
  - **Solutions**: Reassign issues or invite the user back to the project.

### Performance Optimization Tips

- Use 1-3 projects at a time to improve performance.
- Clear unnecessary filters and reload the page if it becomes slow.
- Compare data over different periods (e.g., weekly vs. monthly) to analyze trends rather than peaks.

## Support Commands and Procedures

### Useful Commands

- **Check Logs**: Use `pm2 logs jira-dashboard` to view logs for troubleshooting.
- **Restart Application**: Use `pm2 restart jira-dashboard` to restart the application if necessary.
- **Clean Cache**: Execute `npm cache clean --force` to clear the cache.
- **Reinstall Dependencies**: Remove and reinstall node modules using `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`.

### Testing and Debugging

- **Test After Updates**: Open the dashboard at `http://your-ip:3000` to ensure it loads correctly.
- **Error Handling**:
  - **Build Failed**: Remove node modules and rebuild.
  - **Port in Use**: Stop and restart the application using PM2.
  - **Git Not Found**: Install Git and update the repository.
  - **NPM Not Found**: Verify Node.js and NPM installation and install if necessary.
