## HTTPS with Self-Signed Certificate

### Solution for Corporate Environments

- Use a self-signed certificate for secure internal environments without a domain.
- Provides encryption similar to Let's Encrypt and is cost-free.

### Generating a Self-Signed Certificate

1. **SSH into the Instance**
   ```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@3.83.28.223
   ```

2. **Generate Certificate**
   ```bash
sudo su -
mkdir -p /etc/ssl/private /etc/ssl/certs
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
- keyout /etc/ssl/private/jira-dashboard.key \
- out /etc/ssl/certs/jira-dashboard.crt \
- subj "/C=BR/ST=SP/L=Sao Paulo/O=YourCompany/CN=3.83.28.223"
   ```

3. **Configure Nginx**
   ```bash
cat > /etc/nginx/sites-available/jira-dashboard << 'EOFNGINX'
server {
listen 443 ssl http2;
server_name _;
```

# SSL certificates
}
EOFNGINX

### Security Checklist

- Ensure HTTPS is active and credentials are encrypted.
- Regularly renew the certificate annually.

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Production Deployment

- Ensure all tests pass and the build is error-free.
- Configure `.env.production` with the correct credentials.
- Enable HTTPS in the proxy configuration.

### After Deployment

- Test login with real credentials.
- Verify all APIs return 200 OK status.

## Summary

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the Jira Dashboard project, covering essential aspects such as authentication, architecture, performance, and deployment.
