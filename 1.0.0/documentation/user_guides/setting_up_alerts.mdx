## Introduction

This guide provides instructions on configuring alerts for important metrics and events within the Jira Dashboard. Alerts help in monitoring key performance indicators and ensuring timely responses to critical issues.

## Configuring Alerts

### Types of Alerts

The Jira Dashboard supports several types of alerts that can be configured to monitor different aspects of project management:

- **Issues Atrasadas (Delayed Issues)**: Alerts for issues that are overdue.
- **Velocity Baixa (Low Velocity)**: Alerts when the team's velocity drops below expected levels.
- **Usuários Sobrecarregados (Overloaded Users)**: Alerts for users with an excessive workload.

### Alert Interaction

Alerts in the Jira Dashboard are interactive and can be clicked to reveal more details:

- Clicking on an alert opens a modal window displaying related issues.
- Up to 20 related issues can be viewed within the modal.

### Configuring Alert Criteria

Alerts are based on specific criteria related to project metrics:

- **Taxa de Defeitos (Defect Rate)**: Alerts are triggered when the defect rate exceeds 30%.
- **Tempo para Resolver Bugs (Time to Resolve Bugs)**: Alerts can be configured based on the time taken to resolve bugs, categorized as Rapid (&lt; 2 days), Normal (2-5 days), or Slow (&gt; 5 days).
- **Retrabalho (Rework)**: Alerts are set when the percentage of reworked issues exceeds 20%.

### Visualizing Alerts

The Agile Dashboard provides a visual representation of alerts in the Daily Scrum tab, with expandable sections for detailed views:

- **Ontem Concluí (Completed Yesterday)**: Displays completed tasks.
- **Hoje Vou Fazer (Today's Tasks)**: Shows tasks planned for the day.
- **Issues em Atraso (Delayed Issues)**: Lists issues that are overdue.

Each section is expandable and displays detailed information about each item, including the key, title, status, assignee, priority, and due date.

## Summary

Setting up alerts in the Jira Dashboard allows teams to proactively manage project metrics and respond to critical issues efficiently. By configuring alerts based on defect rates, bug resolution times, and rework percentages, teams can maintain high-quality standards and ensure timely project delivery. The interactive nature of alerts, with detailed modals, enhances the ability to address issues promptly.
