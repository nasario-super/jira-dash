- **Advanced Filters:** Filter by project, sprint, issue type, status, assignee, priority, and time period.
- **Recent Activity:** View the latest updated issues with direct links to Jira.
- **Responsive Layout:** Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile use.
- **Complete Integration:** Direct connection to the Jira Cloud API.

## Technical Stack

The Jira Dashboard is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Charts:** Recharts
- **API Integration:** Axios for Jira REST API
- **State Management:** React Context API and custom hooks
- **Routing:** React Router v6
- **Build Tool:** Vite

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Jira Dashboard, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Jira Cloud account with API permissions
- Jira API token

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <url-do-repositorio>
cd jira-dashboard
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

# or
yarn install

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and edit it with your Jira credentials:

cp env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file:

```env
VITE_JIRA_DOMAIN=sua-empresa.atlassian.net
VITE_JIRA_EMAIL=seu-email@empresa.com
VITE_JIRA_API_TOKEN=seu-token-aqui
```

### Step 4: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

# or
yarn dev
```

Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```

## Deploying on AWS

### Quick Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the Repository on EC2**

   ```bash
cd /home/ssm-user/projetos
git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/jira-dash.git
cd jira-dash
   ```

2. **Run the Deployment Script**

   ```bash
chmod +x install-and-deploy.sh
./install-and-deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Access the Application**

   Open `http://SEU-IP-DA-EC2:3000` in your browser.

### Security Guidelines

- Do not store Jira credentials in the `.env` file. Provide them via the UI login.
