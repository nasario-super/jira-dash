## Introduction

This guide provides essential maintenance guidelines to ensure your system operates efficiently and securely. It includes best practices for handling credentials, monitoring system status, updating production code, troubleshooting common issues, and optimizing performance.

## Security Best Practices

### Credential Handling

To maintain security, avoid exposing credentials in environment files or variables. Instead, follow these steps:

1. User logs in through the UI.
2. Credentials are provided on the login screen.
3. The system stores credentials in `authStore` (localStorage).
4. Requests use the credentials of the logged-in user.

## System Monitoring and Verification

### Checking Application Status

Use the following commands to verify if your application is running correctly:

# List PM2 processes
pm2 list

# View real-time logs
pm2 logs jira-dashboard

# Check status
pm2 status

# Verify if port 3000 is open
lsof -i :3000

# Test access
curl http://localhost:3000

# Check for 404 error in Nginx
curl -v http://localhost:80

### Monitoring in Production

Monitor CPU and memory usage with PM2:

# Monitor CPU and memory usage
pm2 monit

# Save logs to a file
pm2 logs jira-dashboard &gt; /tmp/jira-logs.txt

# Analyze errors
pm2 logs jira-dashboard --err
```

---

```

## Updating Production Code

To update your production code, follow these steps:

# Navigate to the project directory
cd /home/ssm-user/projetos/jira-dash

# Pull updates from the main branch
git pull origin main

# Reinstall dependencies if package.json changed
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Restart the application
pm2 restart jira-dashboard

# Check logs
pm2 logs jira-dashboard
```

---

```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Package Errors

If you encounter package errors, use the following commands:

- For missing package '@tanstack/react-query':
  ```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query --save
  ```

- For missing package 'vite-plugin-pwa':
  ```bash
npm install vite-plugin-pwa --save-dev
  ```

### Build Failures

If the build fails, clear the cache and rebuild:

# Clear cache
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build

### Application Performance

For slow or unresponsive applications, increase Node memory:

# Increase Node memory
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=2048" npm run build

# Or via PM2
pm2 start pm2.config.js --node-args="--max-old-space-size=2048"

### Nginx 502 Bad Gateway

If Nginx returns a 502 error, ensure the application is running:

# Check if application is running
pm2 list

# Check logs
pm2 logs jira-dashboard

# Restart application
pm2 restart jira-dashboard
```
