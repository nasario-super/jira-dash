## Introduction

Task Analytics is a powerful feature designed to help users analyze task performance and identify patterns within their projects. This guide provides an overview of how to utilize the analytics dashboards, interpret the data, and apply insights to improve project outcomes.

## Testing Task Analytics

### Test Cases

1. **Verify Analytics with a Single Project**
   - **Steps:**
     1. Login to the system.
     2. Select only the `INFOSECC` project.
     3. Navigate to `/analytics`.
     4. Check the console for "selectedProjects: ['INFOSECC']".
     5. Ensure metrics are specific to `INFOSECC`.

2. **Verify Analytics with Multiple Projects**
   - **Steps:**
     1. Select `INFOSECC` and `SEGP` projects.
     2. Navigate to `/analytics`.
     3. Check the console for "selectedProjects: ['INFOSECC', 'SEGP']".
     4. Metrics should aggregate data from both projects.
     5. Total issues should approximate 2000 (1000 each).

3. **Verify Advanced Analytics**
   - **Steps:**
     1. Select any project.
     2. Navigate to `/advanced-analytics`.
     3. Ensure analyses are based on real data.
     4. Confirm no "Nenhuma correlação encontrada" message.
     5. Verify "Análise de XX issues" is displayed.

4. **Change Project Selection**
   - **Steps:**
     1. In `/analytics`, select `INFOSECC`.
     2. Return to the Dashboard.
     3. Change selection to `SEGP` only.
     4. Return to `/analytics`.
     5. Metrics should update automatically.

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Analytics displays different data for each project.
- [ ] AI analytics shows results (no "Sem resultados").

- [ ] Console logs "Analytics: Processando dados dos projetos selecionados".
- [ ] Insights are based on real data (not hardcoded).
- [ ] Performance metrics are logical.
- [ ] Predictions vary based on data.
