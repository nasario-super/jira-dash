## Features and Components

### What are the key features of the analytics module?

The analytics module includes several key features:
- **AI Insights**: Provides detailed insights with alerts.

## Testing and Validation

### How can I test the analytics functionality?

Testing the analytics functionality involves several steps:
1. **Single Project Test**: Select only one project (e.g., INFOSECC) and verify that metrics are specific to that project.
2. **Multiple Projects Test**: Select multiple projects (e.g., INFOSECC and SEGP) and ensure metrics aggregate data from both.
3. **Advanced Analytics Test**: Select any project and navigate to `/advanced-analytics` to verify data-based analyses.
4. **Project Selection Change Test**: Change project selections and ensure metrics update automatically.

### What should I do if predictions do not vary based on data?

Ensure that the predictions are based on real data rather than hardcoded values. The system should dynamically update predictions based on the selected project's data.
