## Configuring Environment Variables

### Using Docker and Docker Compose

Environment variables can be configured directly within the `docker-compose.yml` file or through a `.env` file. This approach ensures that sensitive information is not hardcoded into your application code, maintaining security and flexibility.

#### Example `docker-compose.yml` Configuration

```yaml
services:
jira-dashboard:
build: .
ports:
- "3000:3000"
environment:
- NODE_ENV=production
- VITE_API_URL=https://sua-api.com
- LOG_LEVEL=info
restart: always
```

#### Example `.env` File

# .env
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_API_URL=https://sua-api.com
```

To use the `.env` file with Docker Compose, execute:

```
docker-compose --env-file .env up -d

### Secure Production Environment

When configuring environment variables for a production environment, it is crucial to avoid exposing sensitive credentials directly in the `.env` file. Instead, credentials should be provided through secure login mechanisms.

#### Example Production `.env` File

# .env

# Note: In production, credentials should be provided via login, not via environment variables!

# Do not add JIRA_DOMAIN, EMAIL, or API_TOKEN here!

# Optional: URLs for logging, analytics, etc.
VITE_API_URL=https://seu-dominio.com
VITE_ENABLE_LOGS=true
```

```

## Security Considerations

- **Do Not Expose Credentials:** Avoid placing sensitive credentials such as `JIRA_DOMAIN`, `EMAIL`, or `API_TOKEN` in the `.env` file for production environments.
- **User Login for Credentials:** Ensure that credentials are obtained through user login processes rather than being hardcoded or stored in environment variables.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **"Jira configuration is missing" Error:** This error occurs if the application expects credentials in the `.env` file during startup. In production, adjust the application to initialize without these credentials, prompting for user login instead.

### Solutions

- Modify application code to issue warnings instead of errors when credentials are missing, allowing normal initialization.

## Summary

This documentation outlines the best practices for configuring environment variables for the Jira Dashboard application. It emphasizes the importance of security by recommending the use of `.env` files and Docker Compose for managing environment variables, while ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed in production environments.
