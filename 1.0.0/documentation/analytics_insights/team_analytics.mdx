   - Select a single project (e.g., INFOSECC).
   - Verify that metrics are exclusive to the selected project.

2. **Multiple Projects Analytics**
   - Select multiple projects (e.g., INFOSECC and SEGP).
   - Ensure metrics are aggregated from both projects.

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Select any project and navigate to advanced analytics.
   - Confirm that the analysis is based on real data and correlations are identified.

4. **Project Selection Change**
   - Change the project selection and verify that metrics update automatically.

### Checklist for Validation

- Ensure analytics display different data for each project.
- Confirm that insights are based on real data.
