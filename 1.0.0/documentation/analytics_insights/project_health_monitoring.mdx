# Project Health Monitoring

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Group:** Analytics & Insights
**Priority:** High

## Introduction

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for monitoring project health and identifying risks using advanced analytics dashboards. It focuses on ensuring accurate, project-specific metrics that update dynamically as project selections change. The guide is designed to help users leverage analytics and insights to maintain optimal project performance.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Data Integration

- **Dynamic Metrics:** The analytics dashboards are designed to display real-time data, ensuring that metrics such as velocity, efficiency, and trends are based on actual project data.
- **Project-Specific Insights:** Users can select specific projects to view tailored analytics, ensuring that only relevant data is displayed.

### Quality Metrics

- **Defect Rate:** Monitors the ratio of bugs found versus total issues, with an ideal rate of less than 20% and an alert threshold above 30%.
- **Bug Resolution Time:** Categorizes resolution times as fast (&lt;2 days), normal (2-5 days), or slow (&gt;5 days).
- **Test Coverage:** Tracks the percentage of issues with tests and identifies bugs found post-release.
- **Rework Rate:** Measures the ratio of reopened issues to resolved issues, with a low rate being under 10%.

### Advanced Analytics

- **AI-Driven Insights:** Automatically generates insights into trends, anomaly detection, predictions, and recommendations.
- **Performance Analysis:** Compares velocity across sprints and evaluates productivity trends.

### Dashboards

- **Agile Dashboard:** Provides an overview of current sprint issues, including completed, in-progress, blocked, and overdue tasks.
- **Executive Dashboard:** Displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as velocity, throughput, cycle time, lead time, and efficiency.

## Testing and Validation

### Test Cases

1. **Single Project Analytics:**
   - Select a single project (e.g., INFOSECC) and verify that metrics are specific to that project.

2. **Multiple Projects Analytics:**
   - Select multiple projects (e.g., INFOSECC and SEGP) to ensure metrics are aggregated correctly.

3. **Advanced Analytics:**
   - Ensure that advanced analytics display data-based insights without showing "No correlation found."

4. **Project Selection Changes:**
   - Test the dynamic update of metrics when changing project selections.

### Validation Checklist

- Ensure analytics display different data for each project.
- Verify that insights are based on real data.
- Confirm that metrics change with project selection.
- Check that the console logs the correct processing of selected project data.

## Summary

This guide outlines the capabilities of the project health monitoring system, focusing on real-time data integration, quality metrics, and advanced analytics. By following the testing and validation steps, users can ensure that the analytics dashboards provide accurate and actionable insights tailored to their specific project needs.
