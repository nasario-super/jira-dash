# Burnout Prevention

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Group:** Professional Wellbeing
**Priority:** High

## Introduction

Burnout is a critical issue that can significantly impact team productivity and wellbeing. This guide provides insights into identifying and preventing burnout by leveraging dashboards and metrics to monitor team workload and performance. The goal is to support team member wellbeing and enhance productivity by addressing potential burnout indicators.

## Identifying Burnout Indicators

### Workload Overload

Monitoring workload is crucial to prevent burnout. The Agile Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the current workload, including:

- **Total Issues**: Number of issues in the current sprint.
- **In Progress**: Issues currently being worked on.
- **Blocked**: Issues that are stalled.
- **Overdue**: Issues that have missed their deadlines.

### Intelligent Alerts

The dashboard features intelligent alerts that automatically detect:

- Overdue issues
- Blocked issues
- High bug rates
- Overloaded capacity

These alerts help in identifying potential burnout situations by highlighting when a team member or the team as a whole is overburdened.

## Performance and Quality Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The Executive Dashboard provides key performance indicators to help monitor and improve team productivity:

- **Velocity**: Number of issues completed per sprint.
- **Throughput**: Rate of delivery.
- **Cycle Time**: Average time taken to complete an issue.
- **Lead Time**: Time from request to completion.
- **Efficiency**: Percentage of issues completed.

### Quality Metrics

Quality metrics are essential for maintaining a healthy workload and preventing burnout:

- **Defect Rate**: Ratio of bugs found to total issues, with an ideal rate of less than 20%.
- **Time to Resolve Bugs**: Ideal resolution time is less than 2 days.
- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of issues with tests, and bugs found post-release.
- **Rework**: Ratio of reopened issues to resolved issues, with less than 10% considered good.

## Anomaly Detection

### Identifying Anomalies

Anomalies in team performance metrics can indicate potential burnout. The system uses historical averages and standard deviations to detect:

- **Spikes**: Sudden increases in workload.
- **Drops**: Sudden decreases in productivity.
- **Broken Patterns**: Unusual behavior in performance metrics.
- **Outliers**: Data points that deviate significantly from the norm.

### Example of Anomaly Detection

For instance, if the historical velocity is around 13.6 with a standard deviation of 1.14, and the current velocity drops to 8, this would be flagged as an anomaly, indicating a potential issue that needs investigation.

## Summary

Preventing burnout is essential for maintaining team productivity and wellbeing. By using dashboards to monitor workload, performance, and quality metrics, teams can identify potential burnout indicators early. Intelligent alerts and anomaly detection further aid in recognizing when intervention is necessary, ensuring a balanced and healthy work environment.
